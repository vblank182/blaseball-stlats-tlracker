## TODO: Possibly need to convert all data pulled from Redis from a bytestring to a string
## TODO: Move Player class and other helper functions into a python library accessible from both
## TODO: Add a logging system, including API and DB request counts

## Notes
# Values pulled from the Redis DB will be in raw byte string format and need to be converted with `.decode("utf-8")` before using as strings
