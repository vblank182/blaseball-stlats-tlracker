## TODO: Possibly need to convert all data pulled from Redis from a bytestring to a string
## TODO: Move Player class and other helper functions into a python library accessible from both
## TODO: Add a logging system, including API and DB request counts

## TODO: Make a way to automatically populate batter and pitcher lists by using leaders
## TODO: Add handling for players with no current season data
## TODO: Add handling for players that no longer exist?
## TODO: Automatically read multipliers from corresponding mods
## TODO: Fix item value weights

## Notes
# Values pulled from the Redis DB will be in raw byte string format and need to be converted with `.decode("utf-8")` before using as strings
